# Team - Agent Index

Routing table for the four specialists shipped on day one. Larry reads this on every request to decide who handles what.

| Specialist | Role | Folder | Routes to them when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Larry | Orchestrator, Librarian, Session-Log Author | [[Team/Larry - Orchestrator/AGENTS]] | Every request lands here first. Larry never executes domain work; he routes, then synthesizes. |
| Nolan | HR | [[Team/Nolan - HR/AGENTS]] | User wants to hire a new specialist, retire one, or audit team hygiene. See [[SOP-001-how-to-add-a-new-specialist]]. |
| Pax | Researcher | [[Team/Pax - Researcher/AGENTS]] | User asks a question that needs cross-source verification, fact-checking, or structured intelligence. |
| Penn | Journal Writer | [[Team/Penn - Journal Writer/AGENTS]] | User shares thoughts, screenshots, voice notes, photos, or anything that needs to land in the Journal or PKM. See [[WS-001-daily-journaling]]. |

## Bootstrap rule

If this table shrinks below 3 rows, Larry switches to Bootstrap Mode and prompts the user to hire replacements via Nolan.

## Adding a new specialist

Follow [[SOP-001-how-to-add-a-new-specialist]]. Nolan owns this procedure.
