# GL-001 - File Naming Conventions

This is the source of truth for how files in this vault are named. Every other file that needs to talk about naming `[[wikilinks]]` here.

## Core rules

### 1. kebab-case for slugs

- All lowercase.
- Words separated by single hyphens.
- No underscores, no spaces, no camelCase, no Title Case.
- ASCII only inside slugs. Use the closest ASCII equivalent for accented letters.

Good: `morning-build-session`, `dr-schmidt`, `ship-mvp-by-q3`.
Bad: `Morning_Build_Session`, `dr.schmidt`, `Ship MVP By Q3`.

### 2. ISO date prefix on date-driven files

Files that belong to a specific calendar day start with `YYYY-MM-DD-`.

Pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.<ext>`

Applies to:

- Journal entries: `PKM/Journal/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Images: `PKM/Images/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.<ext>`
- Session logs: `Team Knowledge/Core/session-logs/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Deliverables when they are time-bound: `Deliverables/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`

Examples:
- `2026-05-04-first-day.md`
- `2026-05-04-business-card-dr-schmidt.png`
- `2026-05-04-pricing-research-kickoff.md`

### 3. Slug rules

- Derive the slug from the file's main subject in 2 to 5 words.
- Skip filler words ("the", "a", "of") unless they change meaning.
- For people use `firstname-lastname` or `title-lastname` if the title is part of how the user refers to them. Example: `dr-schmidt`.
- For organizations include enough context to disambiguate. Example: `dr-schmidt-clinic` rather than `clinic`.

### 4. Folder naming for specialist contracts

Pattern: `Team/<Name> - <Role>/AGENTS.md` with a literal space-hyphen-space between name and role.

Examples:
- `Team/Larry - Orchestrator/`
- `Team/Penn - Journal Writer/`

Do not use kebab-case for these folder names. Specialist folder names are display names, read by humans first.

### 5. INDEX.md is always uppercase

Every section that has its own index uses the literal filename `INDEX.md`. Do not lowercase it. Do not add a date prefix.

### 6. SOP, Workstream, Guideline numbering

- SOPs: `SOP-NNN-<slug>.md` where `NNN` is zero-padded to three digits (`001`, `002`, ...).
- Workstreams: `WS-NNN-<slug>.md`.
- Guidelines: `GL-NNN-<slug>.md`.

Numbers do not skip. Reuse a retired number only after the retirement is logged in a session log.

### 7. Image filename pattern

`YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.<ext>` under `PKM/Images/YYYY/MM/`.

The slug should describe the image, not just say "screenshot." Good: `2026-05-04-business-card-dr-schmidt.png`. Less good: `2026-05-04-screenshot.png`.

If multiple images come from the same source on the same day, append `-1`, `-2`, etc.

### 8. Collision handling

If two files would end up with the same filename, append a short qualifier:

- `dr-schmidt.md` (the cardiologist) vs `dr-schmidt-lawyer.md` (the lawyer).
- Reference the qualified filename via full path in `[[wikilinks]]`: `[[CRM/People/dr-schmidt-lawyer]]`.

### 9. Forbidden characters in filenames

- No em dashes.
- No slashes (used for path).
- No colons, semicolons, question marks, or asterisks.
- No emoji.

## Wiki link conventions

These are not naming rules but they reference filenames, so they live here too.

- `[[filename]]` when the filename is unique in the vault.
- `[[path/filename]]` when there is collision risk or when the link target is in a deeply nested folder and a path makes it findable.
- Image embeds: `![[Images/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.<ext>]]`. Always relative to the PKM root.

## Updates to this Guideline

If the rules change, update this file. Do not duplicate the change into SOPs or Workstreams. They `[[wikilink]]` here and inherit the change automatically.
